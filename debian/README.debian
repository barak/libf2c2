libf2c for debian
-----------------

Original source downloaded from:
ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/f2c/libf2c.zip

This version of libf2c automatically converts the header file
f2c.h to not use long ints when compiled on alpha or IA64 architectures,
as this generates incorrect code for EQUIVALENCEs (64 bit longs
are used on the alpha), and is not compatible with g77.  On
other platforms the file is used as is.   Similar changes
may turn out to be needed on other 64 bit architectures.

The libF77 has been MODIFIED to work on MC68k machines.  Thus the 
libf77 file now differs from that in the original version.  I hope
this will be temporary until the M68K is fully supported by f2c.  This
only affects the new -trapuv (trap unitialised values) flag which 
requires the co-processor exception control mask to be set up.
